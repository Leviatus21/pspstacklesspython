## This is the port of Python programming language to the Sony PSP console. ##

The current version is **2.5.2** which is the latest ported release from CPython and Stackless Python.

From the [Stackless](http://www.stackless.com) main page:

Stackless Python is an enhanced version of the Python programming language. It allows programmers to reap the benefits of thread-based programming without the performance and complexity problems associated with conventional threads. The microthreads that Stackless adds to Python are a cheap and lightweight convenience which can if used properly, give the following benefits:

  * Improved program structure.
  * More readable code.
  * Increased programmer productivity.


Check the BasicInstallandUsage wiki page for installation and usage instructions.

For more information on module usage, check [PSPPythonModules](PSPPythonModules.md) and [MusicSupport](MusicSupport.md) Wiki pages.

For Python and Stackless Python help follow the links section on the right.

After installing, take a look in the small [GameDemo](http://pspstacklesspython.googlecode.com/files/Gamedemo.zip) created using features from Stackless and PSP modules. This demo can be seen in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=69lvsVjPdlA) provided by a user.

All releases follow the same naming scheme, for example:
StacklessPSP2.5.2\_R1.zip you find the name - StacklessPSP, 2.5.2 which is the Python release and a underline followed by a number which is the StacklessPSP release version.
When multiple releases from the same Python version are made, the number after the underline will change.
